I lost my city in the light of day;
thick smoke, helicopter blades.
Heaven on earth I've never moved so fast.
You'll never know the fear your mama has.
I know your father can't call anymore.
He never meant to be a man of war,
but we found freedom. What will you do now?
Bury the burden baby make us proud.

I lost my city in the light of day;
thick smoke, helicopter blades.
Why would I bother to remember when
our people, baby, die and live again.

Look at this one, I want you to see.
Fashion was high. My hair was so long.
This was maybe '73...
You know I have been adored by good and kind men.
They sent their love with poetry.
By day I gave grand speeches...
At night, like you, we danced to be free.

I lost my city in the prime of my time;
mud, silk, and the dust of life.
I was a diamond of the embassy.
It doesn't matter what I meant to be.

Girl you come from the fortunate ones;
gold, sky, and a first born son.
We don't have words for the way you have grown.
We'll always feed you, you can always come home.
